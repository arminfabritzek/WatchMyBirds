# AGENTS.md â€“ Guidelines for Codex and Agents

> **Purpose**: Ensure that all agents (including Codex) consistently maintain code quality and documentation

1. Installation Instructions
- Install missing Python packages:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

	â€¢	Python-Version: 3.11+
	â€¢	For new dependencies: update requirements.txt and document them.

2. Code Style Rules

Sprache	Formatter / Linter	Besondere Regeln
Python	Black (88 Zeichen), UTF-8	Do not use from â€¦ import *
JavaScript (ES6)	ESLint (airbnb-base)	Use files only inside static/

2.1 Naming Conventions
	â€¢	snake_case for variables and functions
	â€¢	PascalCase for classes
	â€¢	Boolean variables: is_â€¦, has_â€¦, should_â€¦
	â€¢	Loop indices i/j only in very short loops (< 5 lines)
	â€¢	No cryptic abbreviations (df â†’ pandas_dataframe)

2.2 Docstrings
	â€¢	Triple-quoted """ directly below the definition.
	â€¢	First line: verb in 3rd person singular (German).
	â€¢	Multiline for complex functions:

Args:
    name (type): Description.
Returns:
    type: Description.
Raises:
    ErrorType: When the error occurs.

	â€¢	Example:

def lade_daten(pfad: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """LÃ¤dt Daten aus einer CSV-Datei."""

3. Commit Messages

	â€¢	Format: <type>: <short summary>
	â€¢	Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, build, ci
	â€¢	Example:

feat: add hyperparameter tuning with Optuna

â¸»

4. Security Guidelines
	â€¢	Only modify production scripts; do not change files in legacy/.
	â€¢	Tests (pytest) must pass before merging changes.

â¸»

5. Documentation
	â€¢	Every code change must update documentation in the same commit:
	â€¢	PROJECT_STATUS
	â€¢	Add new configuration parameters if applicable.


â¸»

6. Consistency with CODEX.md
	â€¢	All agents must, before execution:
	â€¢	Read CODEX.md (project rules)
	â€¢	Read AGENTS.md (work guidelines)
	â€¢	Instructions from both files have the highest priority.

â¸»

7. CI/CD and Automation
	â€¢	GitHub Actions or other automation must only run if:
	â€¢	Documentation files are up to date.
	â€¢	Tests are successful.
	â€¢	If tests fail â†’ do not automatically merge changes.

â¸»

ðŸ”‘ Important:
	â€¢	Maintaining documentation is a fixed part of every development task.
	â€¢	Codex must not finalize changes without these updates.
	â€¢	Before every commit, read **PROJECT_STATUS.md** and **CODEX.md** to know the current phase and objectives.
	â€¢	Changes to the codebase must implement these objectives.
